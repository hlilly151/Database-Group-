Introduction
we decided to do fbi crime data and with our system people will be able to look at patterns for each year. the advantage for our system is that the user can see how crime changes on a per a year basis from natural disasters or th economy at the time so that our users are able to see crime trends.

Use Case

Business Rules
We will be using Agile methodology for business practices. We will break the project into one-week sprints. When ever a person edits something we will keep track of if in a Google doc. We are going to come up with the product. Then we will estimate how long it will take us to crate each part of the project. Then we will create how long it took us to create each feature. We then we note who every 
created each feature. We will also take note of any tools, IDE, software we use to help create this project.
